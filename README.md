## Notice

1. This workflows uses [@azwhikaru](https://github.com/azwhikaru)'s templates.

2. The GitHub Actions service is **NOT** unlimited, so to avoid waste, do not use unverified source code in this. It is best used to automate builds of repositories that are already stable.

3. Before making any changes, ensure that the repository you are operating in belongs to you. **"Fork" if you want to commit code; otherwise, use "Use this template."**
